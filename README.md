# Reference Style Links

Apparently this is a thing? You can [use references as link values](link1) instead of writing in a full path as an inline link. This is called a "reference style link." [Mind. Blown.](mindblown)

You can reference the [same link](link1) in [multiple places](link1) without having to worry about it matching or updating it in a bunch of places in the file.
